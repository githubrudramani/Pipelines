 ## A. Bulk-RNAseq Preprocessing Pipelines
This is bulk RNAseq data preprocessing pipe lines which takes raw fastq files and outputs count matrix.
I have desinged the workflow using simple bash script as well as using Snakemake.
- For bash script follow the folder: ***bash_script***
- For Snakemake follow the folder: ***snakemake***
