Central limit theore:
	Mean of samples = Population mean
	sd of sample means (SE)  = sd of population/squrt(number of samples) >> it is also called margin of error ( Standard Error;SE)

For Normal Distriubution:
	95% of sample means fall within 2 * SE  (exact 1.96) distance of population mean.
	1.96 are CRITICAL values of Z for 95% confidence.
	
	98% of sample means fall within 2.33 * SE   distance of population mean.
	2.33 are CRITICAL values of Z for 98% confidence.

	99% of sample means fall within 2.576 * SE   distance of population mean.
	2.576 are CRITICAL values of Z for 99% confidence.
	
	
	Confidence Interval:
	98 % confidence interval for population mean : (sample mean (x_bar) - Z(=2.33) * SE),    sample mean (x_bar) + Z(	2.33) *SE)
	95 % confidence interval for populatin mean  : (sample mean (x_bar) - Z(=1.96) * SE),    sample mean (x_bar) + Z(	1.96) *SE)

	Margin of Error : Z *SE 

Probality of getting sample mean (x_bar) from popultion mean (mu):
   first calculate SE = SD/sqrt(n)

   z score = (x_bar - mu)/ SE
   and use z- score table : P(Z < score)  take direct number , P(Z> score) take 1- number

 Levels of likelihood
 	If probability of getting sample mean less than ( alpha levels :: 5% or 0.05, 1% or 0.001, .01% or 0.0001), which is usually considered unlikely.
 	To get z-critical value for alpha level (get the z-value  for area 1-alpha level)
